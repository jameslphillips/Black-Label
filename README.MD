## Sidechains

Sidechains are new blockchains, but are backed by Bitcoin rather than being an altcoin. Using "two-way pegging" these sidechains provide a method for developers to make changes and play around with blockchain rules in a separate blockchain, while keeping these coins linked to Bitcoin.

### Introduction
  * [Ask Dr. Bitcoin: What are Side-Chains](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2014/04/21/bitcoin-sidechains/)

## Javascript & Digibyte


### Setting Up on Mac
     Javascript & Digibyte
If using a Mac, you'll need some basic knowledge how to use the Terminal and the Mac's command line interface, and you'll need to install brew, node and git. A basic tutorial on how to do this is at https://github.com/ChristopherA/intro-mac-command-line

You can also use this script which sets up your Mac automatically, but the above teaches you how do to do it manually https://github.com/blockchainu/prepare-osx-for-blockchain-webdev

### Introduction to Javascript

 

Javascript is in both server (node) and client (browser) development. Some basics of Javascript are common to both. Here are some resources for learning about Javascript that are generally applicable to both platform.

  * [Learn Javascript](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gitbookio/javascript/details) - a free online book with interactive exercises.

### Introduction to Node & Javascript

Server-based Javascript typically uses Node. These Javascript learning resources are Node specific:

  * I like the command-line based [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io) tutorials, as they require you to both use the command line and to create real working code. These are the basic interactive tutorials, but    there are many more available.
   * Learn javascripting basics `npm install -g javascripting`
   * Learn Node basics: `npm install -g learnyounode`
   * Learn git: `npm install -g git-it`

### Online courses on Javascript

Most of these courses teach general Javascript, but tend to be more client-side Javascript oriented.

Free online courses:
  * [Code Academy: Javascript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) is an online interactive course that comes highly recommend. The course says 10 hours, but one of our students reported that it took him about 17 hours over 5 days, and found Q&A forum and glossary both helpful.
  * [How to Learn JavaScript Properly](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/)
  * [Introduction to Computing Principles](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs101/)
  * [Introduction to JavaScript Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQaAGmHNn9s&list=PL46F0A159EC02DF82

Some non-free online courses:
  * [Node.js Essential Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u-j7uqU7sI&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBMdkKFn3HasZnnAqVjzHn_)

### General Javascript Books and eBooks

Some general Javascript online books in eBook (in rough order of preference)

  * [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net)
  * [JavaScript Guide](http://javascriptbook.com/)
  * [JavaScript Garden](http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/)

### Local-client Javascript Tools & Playgrounds

These tools can be cloned from github to allow you to use your browser to play around with various bitcoin capabilities:

  * [Bip32 Generator](https://github.com/bip32/bip32.github.io) `git clone https://github.com/bip32/bip32.github.io.git ; cd bip32.github.io ; open index.html` lets you create Bip32 Deterministic Heirarchical Keys (prefix xpub* and xprv*) based on a simple brainwallet (aka arbitrary mnemonic) passphrase.
  * [Bip39 Mnemonic Code Converter](https://github.com/dcpos/bip39) `npm install bip39 ; npm run compile` lets you create Bip39 mnemonics (typically 12 words) used for deterministic keys, typically for Bip32.

### digibyte.js
  * [digibyte JavaScript](https://github.com/digicontributer/digibyte-js)(https://playground.digibyte.io/#/address) @-digicontributer
  * [Bitcoin-Digibyte 101 - Getting Started With Bitcore - A Full JavaScript Implementation of Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmkN8yYyOv8)
    * https://github.com/wobine/blackboard101/blob/master/BitcoreDayOne.html - code for the above
  * [Bitcoin-Digibyte Quick Tools](https://github.com/chulini/bitcoin-quick-tools) - Simple browser-based app (loaded locally) that uses digibyte.js. Has key and address generator and simple transaction tool. Useful working example of browserfy digbyte.js code.

### Testnet Faucets

You'll need Digibyte testnet coins while developing apps with Digibyte. List in rough order of reliability and number of coins offered.

  * Under Develpoment  


### Digibyte Standards
  * BIP32 - Digibyte Deterministic Heirarchical Keys
  * Good article on [Deterministic Wallets](http://blog.richardkiss.com/?p=313)
  * Discussion of [BIP32 Advantages and Flaws](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/8396/deterministic-wallets-advantages-flaw/)
  * The [BIP0032 Standard](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032)
  * [Bip32 Generator](https://github.com/bip32/bip32.github.io) `git clone https://github.com/bip32/bip32.github.io.git ; cd bip32.github.io ; open index.html` lets you create Bip32 Deterministic Heirarchical Keys (prefix xpub* and xprv*) based on a simple brainwallet (aka arbitrary mnemonic) passphrase.

### What is DigiByte?
----------------

### DigiByte (DGB) is a rapidly growing, four-year-old decentralized global blockchain with a focus on cyber security, payments & secure communications technologies.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the DigiByte Core software, see https://digibyte.io

### DigiByte FAQ
-------------
* Total Supply: 21 Bilion DigiBytes in 21 years
* Block Timing: 15 Second Blocks, (1.5 Minutes per algo)
* Mining Algorithims: Five (Sha256, Scrypt, Groestl, Skein & Qubit)
* Blockchain Type: Public, Decentralized UTXO based
* Launch Date: January 10th, 2014

You can mine DigiByte on one of five seperate mining algorithms. Each algo averages out to mine 20% of new blocks. This allows for much greater decentraliztion than other blockchains. In order for an attacker to hardfork DigiByte the attacker would need to control 93% of the hashrate on 1 algo, and 51% of the other 4 making DigiByte much more secure against PoW attacks than other blockchains.

* DigiShield Hardfork: Block 67,200, Feb. 28th, 2014

* MultiAlgo Hardfork: Block 145k, Sep. 1st 2014

* MultiShield Hardfork: Block 400k, Dec. 10th 2014

* DigiSpeed Hardfork: Block 1,430,000 Dec. 4th 2015

DigiByte currently can handle 280+ transactions per second.
The 2015 DigiSpeed hardfork introduced changes that double the capacity of the network every two years.

Total Supply: More DigiBytes, lower price, more micro transactions, better price stability.
